    I am currently a Life Sciences student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
    Currently, I am also CyberCoach of the coaching association of the School of Life Sciences, which means that I maintain our website at <a href="http://coaching.epfl.ch/sv">coaching.epfl.ch/sv</a>. As part of the coaching association we are helping students integrate and succede at EPFL.

    I enjoy hiking, skiing and mountaineering in general. Running before starting the day helps keep you healthy, though I admit that I don't always.
